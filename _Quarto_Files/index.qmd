# Welcome!  

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics at Maastricht University.

My primary research interest lies in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in how people make economic decisions that involve risk or intertemporal tradeoffs, such as behavior on financial markets or individual borrowing and saving decisions. To answer these questions I use theory-based laboratory experiments but also large-scale, representative studies to structurally estimate the effect of economic preferences on economic decisions.

Additionally, I work on belief elicitation, including a [new method](/tools) for eliciting parametric belief distributions, and have recently begun exploring the darker aspects of human behavior, such as exploitation.  

Together with Peter Werner, I co-organize the annual [M-BEES and M-BEPS](https://sites.google.com/view/mbees-mbeps/home) symposia, which bring together researchers and practitioners in experimental and behavioral economics.  

In 2018, I received the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for my research on debt aversion.
