    "text": "I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics at Maastricht University.\nMy primary research interest lies in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in how people make economic decisions that involve risk or intertemporal tradeoffs, such as behavior on financial markets or individual borrowing and saving decisions. To answer these questions I use theory-based laboratory experiments but also large-scale, representative studies to structurally estimate the effect of economic preferences on economic decisions.\nAdditionally, I work on belief elicitation, including a new method for eliciting parametric belief distributions, and have recently begun exploring the darker aspects of human behavior, such as exploitation.\nTogether with Peter Werner, I co-organize the annual M-BEES and M-BEPS symposia, which bring together researchers and practitioners in experimental and behavioral economics.\nIn 2018, I received the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for my research on debt aversion."
