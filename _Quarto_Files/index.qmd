# Welcome!  

I am Thomas Meissner, an Associate Professor of Economics in the Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics at Maastricht University.

My research focuses on experimental and behavioral economics, with a particular interest in how people make economic decisions involving risk or intertemporal tradeoffs, including behaviors in financial markets and individual borrowing or saving choices. To explore these topics, I combine theory-driven laboratory experiments with large-scale, representative studies, using structural estimation techniques to analyze the impact of economic preferences on decision-making.  

Additionally, I work on belief elicitation, including a [new method](/tools) for eliciting parametric belief distributions, and have recently begun exploring the darker aspects of human behavior, such as exploitation.  

Together with Peter Werner, I co-organize the annual [M-BEES and M-BEPS](https://sites.google.com/view/mbees-mbeps/home) symposia, which bring together researchers and practitioners in experimental and behavioral economics.  

In 2018, I received the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for my research on debt aversion.
