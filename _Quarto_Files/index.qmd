::: {#hero-heading} 
## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics at Maastricht University.

My primary research interest lies in the fields of experimental and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in how people make economic decisions that involve risk or intertemporal tradeoffs, such as behavior on financial markets or individual borrowing and saving decisions. To answer these questions I use theory-based laboratory experiments but also large-scale, representative studies to structurally estimate the effect of economic preferences on economic decisions.

Together with Peter Werner, I organize the yearly [M-BEES and M-BEPS](https://sites.google.com/view/mbees-mbeps/home) symposia.

In 2018 I was awarded the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for my work on debt aversion.  More information on the project can be found here.
